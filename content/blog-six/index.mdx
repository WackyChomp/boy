Life is all about living to see another day and experiencing!

When confronting the unknown, it's perfectly fine to feel uneasy. Here
are some examples of experiences in life which may cause discomfort:

1. Interview for a life changing job
2. Skydiving from 7,000 ft altitude
3. Cooking a large meal for party / event
4. Waking up late despite going through multiple alarms
5. Cleaning your place before guests arrive

We have all been there...at least for some of the experiences listed above :P
